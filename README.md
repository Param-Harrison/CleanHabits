Did you know that around 40% of everything we do on a daily basis is habitual? This means that a big part of our lives is almost entirely on autopilot! Think this through for a second and evaluate those habits of yours. Do they empower you or disempower you? Do they limit you or free you? or Do they help you or hinder you from reaching your goals?

In reality, successful people are simply those with successful habits, and they give small efforts repeated day in and day out. I've build an app around this idea of building great habits and sticking to it. 

Clean Habits is a Minimalist Habit Tracker that helps you to achieve good goals using data analytics

Clean Habits helps you to start with a habit, like "wake up early day" or "eat less suger everyday" or "visit the gym 3 times per week". It gives you many customizations over your habits like setting goals, repetations, etc.

Once you have the habits set, clean habits can provide your detailed charts to track your behaviour for each habits. Data Analytics can then help you showcase which habits you're easily sticking to and which ones you're avoiding. The idea is once you create a habit you should complete it everytime and maintain a completion streak.

The reality is habits are not build in a day, it takes time and people do fail in the begining, but they slowly learn and then start reaching their goals. Clean Habits lets you see the bigger picture and visualize you far you've acheived in terms of habit completion using charts and analytics.

There is nothing more bad than missing your streak and not completion your habit for the day. Clean Habits can send you timely reminders so that you remember to you don't miss your task and maintain your streak

 _Open Doodles Illustrations by Pablo Stanley_
 
      Open Doodles is a set of free illustrations that embraces the idea of Open Design. 
      You can copy, edit, remix, share, or redraw these images for any purpose 
      without restriction under copyright or database law (CC0 license.)

      I hope that this kind of resource makes it easier for designers to show the value of illustration in their mockups. 
      Maybe you use these images as placeholders, before you're ready to hire an illustrator. 
      Or perhaps this will encourage others to create their own kit and share it with the world.
